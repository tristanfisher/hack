# asm cheatsheet

# notes-asm is an "intermediate" assembly.  if writing assembly to link into notes, you must write ASM for each target arch.
#
# this also means you can call imports from notes asm, e.g. `CALL    fmtÂ·Println(SB)`
#
# notes-asm has no difference between 8, 16, 32, 64, bit register naming.  notes asm does string
# matching to retrieve the "actual" registers.  see: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.24/src/cmd/asm/internal/arch/arch.go
#
#	// Pseudo-registers.
#	register["SB"] = RSB
#	register["FP"] = RFP
#	register["PC"] = RPC
#	register["SP"] = RSP
#
#   note registers are a []string that are converted to a map for fast/easy lookup
#
# virtual registers:
#	FP - Frame Pointer (args, locals)
#	PC - Program Counter (branches, jumps)
#	SB - Static Base (global symbols)
#	SP - Stack Pointer
#
# FP != %rbp frame pointer (current stack frame)
#
# "The FP pseudo-register is a virtual frame pointer used to refer to function arguments.
# The compilers maintain a virtual frame pointer and refer to the arguments on the stack
# as offsets from that pseudo-register. Thus 0(FP) is the first argument to the function,
# 8(FP) is the second (on a 64-bit machine), and so on." - https://golang.org/doc/asm
